# node-scaffold

A starter for building node-based projects and libraries

## Get started

```bash
npm install
```

## Development zen

This starter includes a watch task which makes development faster and more interactive.

```bash
npm run start
```

## View test coverage

It's a good idea to maintain 100% unit test coverage, and always test in the environments you target.

To generate and view test coverage, run:

```bash
npm run cover
```

This will create an HTML report of test coverage – source-mapped back to Typescript – and open it in your default browser.
